# [A](https://ukb-dt.github.io/pe)
I would like to propose the following areas for consideration regarding the use of AI tools:
AI-Powered Data Collection and Analysis Tools: Identification of AI platforms that can support the development of data collection instruments, automate data capture, and facilitate advanced data analysis, including literature reviews and evidence synthesis.
Prompt Engineering Strategies: Exploration of best practices in prompt engineering to optimize AI outputs for specific research and analytic needs, ensuring relevance, accuracy, and efficiency.
Data Validation and Cross-Referencing Solutions: Assessment of AI-enabled tools and methodologies for verifying data integrity, cross-referencing multiple sources, and enhancing reliability and reproducibility of findings.

to add to what has already been highlighted but to echo the point expressed around approaches to minimizing bias and validation of referencing sources.

# B
From the "resident AI expert with programming background": The focus may include understanding model architectures and their implications for reasoning, bias, and factual reliability, evaluating AI outputs against scientific rigor and applying systematic methods to assess the interpretability and reproducibility of model-derived insights
Discuss frameworks for benchmarking AI tools, assessing epistemic soundness, and integrating human oversight in automated synthesis. 
Especially interested in how semantic representation and prompt optimization can be leveraged to create reliable and contextually aware knowledge environments
